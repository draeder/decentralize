# Decentralize
> Connect decentralized technology stacks together

Decentralize aims to provide a simple API for rapid development of adapters that can integrate disparate p2p stacks with each other. Most decentralization stacks have things in common. They all emit and listen for events. Many announce a 'topic' or some kind of swarm identifier. Some have end-to-end security built in, some don't.

Decentralize accepts a custom initialization function and corresponding desired methods object for each stack.

## Usage
`npm i decentralize`
