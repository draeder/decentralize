# Decentralize
> Connect decentralized technology stacks together

Most decentralization stacks have things in common. They all emit and listen for events. Many announce a 'topic' or some kind of swarm identifier. Some have end-to-end security built in, some don't.

Decentralize aims to provide a simple API for rapid development of adapters that can integrate disparate p2p stacks with each other.
